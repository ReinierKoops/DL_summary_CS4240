      "source": "## Paper 3: ImageNet Classifiers Generalize?\nImage classifiers do not generalize reliably. This is shown by trying to reproduce the test results of image recognition models on a **new** test set which is sampled from the **same** data source, following the **same** data cleaning protocol as described in the paper. This is tested by reproducing some of the highly ranked models in this manner.\n\nThe classification models fail to reach their original accuracy scores using the new test set (CIFAR-10 3 to 15% drop, ImageNet 11 to 14%). However, the ranking of the highly ranked models is mostly preserved.\n\nThere are three types of gaps identified:\n- **Generalization gap**: determined solely by random sampling error. Since the new test set had 10.000 data points, this should at most lead to maximally +/- 1% difference in accuracy. Thus does **not explain** the drop in accuracy.\n- **Adaptivity gap**: the adaptation of a model to the test set with regards to the true distribution. If we assume this to be true that would mean each model's hyperparameters are tuned in somewhat similar fashion with regards to the test set. Since the ranking of the models are preserved, intuitively it would also seem **unlikely to explain it**.\n- **Distribution gap**: the Systemic difference between the current true distribution proxied by the current test set and the new true distribution, which the new test set is a proxy for. This seems the **most likely explanation**.\n\nAlso the paper suggests that the gap could be explained by the inability to generalize to slightly “harder” images than those found in the original test sets.\n\n\n**Question**: Models trained on existing datasets may not generalize to new test sets sampled from the same distribution. What was the paper’s hypothesis for that?\n- “The existing test sets have been used too many times and existing models are tuned to the particular test set.” - This is what is initially assumed but later debunked by the fact that ranking is preserved.\n",

      "source": "## Paper 4: Scaling down Deep learning\n\nProjects run at large scale require enormous amounts of **time**, **money**, and **electricity**. MNIST-1D is a minimalist, low-memory, low-compute alternative to classic deep learning benchmarks. This dataset differentiates more clearly between linear, non-linear, and convolutional models in comparison with the original MNIST dataset. In addition, MNIST is somewhat large for a toy dataset, and hard to hack (researchers cannot easily vary parameters).\n\nThe authors state that small scale research is important in the DL field, because it permits creativity, allows deep understanding, improves interpretability, reproducibility and iteration speed. It is easy to perform ablation studies to isolate causal mechanisms of results (e.g. for finding what attributes to a lottery ticket’s success). MNIST-1D has rapid iteration as a priority. However, large scale research is also required: to expose fertile new research territory.\n\nProperties of MNIST-1D\n- Extremely small (smaller than MNIST)\n- Able to identify models with (spatial) inductive biases\n- Easy to hack, extend or modify\n- Analogous to large-scale problems\n- Differentiates clearly between linear, non-linear, and convolutional models (e.g. logistic vs MLP vs CNN vs GRU) \n\n",

Although shallow can learn Deep for Speech, not for Image recognition. \n- **A network with a single hidden layer can approximate every decision boundary**.\n- Accuracy can be significantly be improved using several layers of convolution.\n- On high dimensional data shallow neural networks perform worse than deep neural networks.\n- Distillation for models can lead to accurate results.\n\n",
